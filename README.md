Maze Solver Robot â€“ 2025

A robotics project that demonstrates autonomous maze solving using sensors and algorithms. The robot navigates through a two-section maze by:

Detecting walls with ultrasonic sensors

Following lines across an inclined bridge with IR sensor arrays

Making decisions at intersections using maze-solving algorithms

Optimizing its path to reach the goal in the shortest possible time

ðŸš€ Features

Wall Following â€“ Navigate within a grid maze using ultrasonic sensors

Line Following â€“ Cross an inclined bridge (<35Â°) using IR sensor arrays

Pathfinding â€“ Explore and determine the shortest route

Path Optimization â€“ Replay optimized path for faster completion

Fully Autonomous â€“ No human intervention once started
